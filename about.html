                    I still remember it today. Our first trip as a Saigon Heat team back in September 2015 to Manila. We have been working hard the whole off season with Coach Tony & Dave from the National Championships in Bac Lieu to getting into a chemistry with my new teammates Dave, Lenny and Mo. First game 7 AM against NU in Philippines. We won the tip off and I got the ball moved down the floor. Passed it up to Lenny who took off the ground and have a major throw down. Celebrating on the way back. Back paddling I felt something, something in my back. For each and every step after that, it felt like a knife was running from the back of my head all the way down to the heel. I screamed and I was so afraid to fall at that finish line and never get to do what I aimed for the longest...
                    
                    Before all of this I had spent a full summer preparing myself in Sweden. I lifted weights harder than ever. Lifting heavier than ever. Looking back at it, I might have overworked. But this was the biggest adventure I ever wanted. Finishing promotion to the highest league in Sweden with my team Malbas was a huge accomplishment but I decided to take my talents back to where my parents come from. I was prepared for so long and I still remember when my dad and I, 11 years old was sitting in the living room getting the signal in for VTV4 and we watched football. And I remembered how proud my dad was to wake up early in the morning to sing along with the national anthem. There and then my dream to represent Vietnam in the game that we all love. Basketball. </p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Going through all the motions. Having that dream in mind at all time. That was my ultimate dream was to play in the NBA and go back and represent Vietnam in a competition where my dad would sit at home singing along with me from our living room while I was going to represent Vietnam. But first, I had to make sure I put the work in. And yes, I was lucky. First time I tried to play the game, I didn’t love it right away. Because I remember, I wasn’t the best. As a competitor as I am, I aimed for the best player right away around my age in my hometown of Engelholm. Niklas Sellin. He was so tall, skilled and his fundamentals was on point. He already established himself as one of the best players in the country for our age by this time. And I had the opportunity to actually see him everyday and one day compete against him. He became my goal to beat and as lucky as I am, his dad and uncle Jorgen & Christer Sellin took me on under their wings because maybe back then they saw something in that asian kid that never wanted to leave the gym ever. I can never thank them enough for the leadership and work ethic they instilled in me. Always wanted to play everyone 1-1 and was so cocky that even when he lost, he wouldn’t go home until they force him to. Yup, that was me. We went on to go through Swedish youth national U15U16,U18 and U20 teams together, summer camps, Lulea national basketball high school 1400km away from our beloved hometown and everyday after homework we were in that gym and this is where I fell love with the grind. The grind first, then the game. I realized that the harder I worked on my craft, the easier the games would become. I’ve been through it all, the struggles of pressure coming mostly from myself but also everything around. I have to get better now, I have to beat this guy now. And that kept going and going. But I realized that some stuff takes time and commitment to become true with a little bit of luck. </p>

                    By the end of my high school years. My mom, the biggest supporter I’ve ever had. Suffered from Cancer. She and my sister hid it at first from me because I was so focused on the journey that I already started with my basketball 1400 km away from our hometown. But when they couldn’t hide it from me anymore. It was already too late. I still remember googling all the stages of it. Completely thrown away by the news and flew back home as soon as I could. It was one of the hardest parts in life to go through. To grow through what you go through. Life does that sometimes. I hope with all of my heart that this never happens to you at such young age but I want to say that even me was able to come out of it. Mom was able to come to my graduation and a few weeks after that time was in. I remember that I promised her two things. One was to get married to someone that also followed her same religious believes that all of our family practices throughout our lives and second was to go back to our motherland to get a better understanding for what I come from. All these years not being able to go with her back to Hai Phong because of basketball in Sweden.

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">I was now offered to go to Vietnam thanks to Basketball in Vietnam with the Saigon Heat. I can’t thank the decision makers enough. A Connor, C Phuong, A Henry & Coach Tony. What all of you probably never knew was that this decision helped me fulfill what I always wanted to do since my early days in the living room with my dad, all those early mornings and nights grinding with Niklas and ultimately the promises to my mom. Thank you, Thank you thousands. Because without you, this would have never happened. 

                    Through all of this and as I am writing this. I can’t really believe that I did all of that. Through the darkest days and the brightest moments. We all have our own paths. Losing games into winning seasons, Winning games into losing at the finish line. Winning medals and championships and losing everything. Scoliosis, Herniated discs, MCL & Meniscus tears. Failed exams. Graduation. Heart broken. Far away from beloved one. Lost loved ones. Found love ones. 
                    
                    So to go back to the initial story. It would’ve never happened if it wasn’t for me re injuring my back last year doing my all trying to get a spot with last years Saigon Heat team before breaking another disc flipping tires. But ultimately my girlfriend YenLinh. You are the cornerstone in all of this. You’re the one that kept me going when all was dark. I can never thank you enough. You are Next Level. Without you I wouldn’t be able to do what I love the most everyday. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is when Next Level Basketball was born. On Estella and BP outdoor courts to play tournaments, see you reach your goals of dunking, making teams, national teams, pro teams or what ever you have. We are in this together. Throughout this journey I’ve learned a few things that I believe is my mission to pass on to our 60+ players in Next Level. There are good days and days that could be better. But we will always look ahead of that. Being better than we were yesterday. Make the best out of every opportunity we get. Never stop dreaming and not be satisfied with goals we accomplish but to set new ones. 
                    
                    I believe that we all can achieve anything we put our mind to. If we really want something. It has to be as much as we want to breathe. To always be your best. Everything counts. That is what I live by and that is also why I believe we can overcome everything. No matter how hard it may look. But once it’s done, next time it comes around. You will realize it wasn’t as hard as it first looked. And that applies to everything you do in life. On and off the court. But as I am learning as well as you. We still have a lot ahead of us to overcome but also to accomplish. Like I said. It’s not how you start.
                    
                    It is how you finish. </p>
